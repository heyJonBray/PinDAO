# PinDAO Challenges 🏗️

I've identified several challenges that require ongoing development and community collaboration.

## Technical Challenges 🖥️

### Verification Mechanisms

The protocol currently relies on peer reporting to verify content pinning, which is susceptible to potential gaming and manipulation.

- Properly incentivize "verifiers" to check IPFS pins against participating nodes

### File Size Constraints

The existing design lacks dynamic scaling for file size, creating uneven storage cost burdens for nodes.

- Dynamic reward system that scales with file size
- Tiered storage pricing

## Economic Challenges 💸

### Token Price Volatility

Token price fluctuations could lead to unpredictable node compensation and reduced long-term economic stability.

- Research stabilization mechanisms like rebasing
- Hybrid reward with $ETH or $USDC
- Allow node operators to choose what currency they accept in addition to $PIN
  - This could open up a kind of sub-DAO for communities that utilize PinDAO

### Initial Bootstrap Phase

Achieving critical mass of nodes and user demand will be tough.

- Incentivized testnet and/or grants for early node operators
- Market direct to IPFS communities

## Governance Challenges 🏛️

### Decentralized Dispute Resolution

Still need a comprehensive system for resolving node behavior disputes that minimizes biased arbitration.

- Transparent dispute resolution framework with reputation-weighted voting.
- Make sure token incentives are aligned.

## Integration Challenges 🔗

### Developer Experience

- Develop an SDK and dev-friendly integration tools for node operators and verifiers.

### Cross-chain Expansion

Need to manage composability of contracts that might directly utilize PinDAO services to manage metadata with preferred network for node operator rewards. Need to maximize interoperability with the protocol while reducing fragmentation of rewards and liquidity.

- Cross-chain messaging protocols
- Deploy core PinDAO contracts on one network, and issue rewards on node providers preferred network using CCIP on the back end

## Competitive Landscape 🌐

There's already established competition in this space, and PinDAO needs a unique value prop.

- Proof-of-concept for contract metadata pinning directly through PinDAO
- DeFi integration for better economic incentives
